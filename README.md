# Hello peoples!
This is our code for the 2025 FRC competition Reefscape.

## About our robot
- We use a swerve drive system with 8 Kraken x60 motors
- It contains several subsystems including ones for our elevator, coral mechanism, and algae mechanism. Each of these is powered by either a Kraken x60 or Kraken x40 motor.
- It uses Pathplanner for autonomous with named commands to run mechanisms in auto.

## About the code
- Our robot is command based
- It has custom built commands for automatic angle management and elevator height management.
- The custom commands use sensors including a pigeon gyroscope axis for coral mechanism and Kraken motor encoders for elevator and algae.
